# DVD Rental Database - Advanced SQL queries
In this project I am creating some reports using the Sakila Sample Database. It is a programmatically generate database for a fictitious DVD rental chain. The database is open source under the BSD License. The database can be downloaded at <https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-sample-database/>.

01-first_purchase.sql

## Customer Account Summary
*SQL used: CTE, window, partition, row_number(), array_agg(), join*
